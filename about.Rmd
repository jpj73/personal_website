I'm an organismal biologist, currently doing a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University.  

I was born and raised in Ecuador where I quickly found special interest in the amazing biodiversity around me. I spent most of my undergraduate career chasing neotropical spiders, which took me to conduct fieldwork in the mountain forests and the Amazon basin. Recently, I have found new interest in the natural compounds that mediate ecological interactions, which I will be exploring during my first year of graduate school.  

I am committed to efforts in creating equal opportunity and representation of all groups in science, specially those from developing countries. I strongly believe that diversity is an asset that strengthens our community by the enrichment of various backgorunds, life experiences and points of view.
